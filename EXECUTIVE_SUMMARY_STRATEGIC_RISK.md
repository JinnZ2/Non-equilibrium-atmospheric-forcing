Technical Executive Summary: Non-Equilibrium Atmospheric Forcing
1. Statement of Problem
Current climate and economic models (CMIP6/Standard Equilibrium) treat the stratosphere as a passive chemical sink. This research identifies a Critical Blind Spot: the transition of the upper atmosphere into a complex, coupled electromagnetic medium due to the unprecedented mass-loading of aluminum-oxide (\bm{Al_2O_3}) from LEO satellite constellations, combined with potential Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) of sulfur (\bm{SO_2}).
2. The Mechanics of Failure: "The Coupled Shell"
Standard models analyze these particles as isolated chemical reactants. Our modeling demonstrates Emergent Coupling Mechanisms:
• Geometric EM Resonance: High-density \bm{Al} particulate creates a conductive "mesh" in the mesosphere. Solar events (CMEs/Solar Maxima) interact with this mesh, creating induction effects that traditional "dust" models ignore.
• Catalytic Synergism: The presence of \bm{Al} catalysts in a high-\bm{SO_2} environment lowers the activation energy for ozone (\bm{O_3}) destruction. We forecast a Power-Law acceleration of ozone depletion once a specific mass-threshold is reached, leading to a 10-year depletion window.
3. Strategic National Risk: The Rural-Logistics Feedback Loop
The primary "Black Swan" risk is not just environmental, but Infrastructure Fragility.
• Logistics Fluidity: Global Just-In-Time (JIT) supply chains, particularly in rural raw-material extraction zones, have zero tolerance for PNT (Positioning, Navigation, and Timing) degradation.
• Systemic Multiplier: If the "Atmospheric Shell" creates even a 2% increase in EM interference, the cumulative delay in the "truck-to-rail-to-fab" supply chain results in a non-linear spike in the Cost of Compute for AI industries.
4. Conclusion & Forecast
The "Year of Collapse" is currently modeled at 2035–2038, assuming current satellite launch trajectories. The economic impact is not a "slow decline" but a Phase Transition—a sudden shift where the atmosphere becomes a hostile environment for the high-precision electronics and power grids that support modern AI and rural extraction.
